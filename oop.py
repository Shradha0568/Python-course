#Encapsulation:


'''The variables that are written
 using _variableName are Protected and written __variableName are
private variables, these private variables can be accessed using getter and setters'''

#static method:

#it is the method which belongs to class instead of instance of class.
# @staticmethod is the decorator @property decorator is the decorator make a method act like an 
# attribute so you can access it without parentheses, but it still runs code in the background.

#isinstance(method_name, class_name)
#used to check if an object is an instance of a class or a subclass.
